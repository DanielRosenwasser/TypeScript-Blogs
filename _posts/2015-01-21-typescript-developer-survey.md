We have a [short survey][1] for TypeScript developers to help us better gauge the community and direct our efforts. If you're using TypeScript, you can help us out by filling out the survey and sharing the link. If you'd like to share more directed feedback with the team, feel free to log an issue on [GitHub][2] or post [a question on StackOverflow][3]. Your input will help focus our engineering time on the things that will bring the most value to the TypeScript community. <span style="text-decoration: line-through">Head to the <a title="TypeScript Developer Survey" href="http://www.instant.ly/s/mj1X3">TypeScript Developer Survey</a>.</span> 
Thanks for your feedback! We're crunching the numbers on the survey and will be posting a summary of the results later this week.
