We are excited to see the feedback and interest in all the new features that we’ve released with TypeScript 0.9.  We’re already seeing users converting hundreds of thousands of lines to the new version and using the new features in earnest. 

Today, we’re releasing an update that addresses a few of the highest priority issues that have been raised so far by users moving to the 0.9.0 release.  This update covers [incorrect codegen with getters][1], [poor errors with non-UTF-8 files][2], [incorrect type inference][3], and more.

We appreciate your feedback.  It’s helped make TypeScript a stronger, richer tool.  We encourage you to [update to the 0.9.0.1 release][4] and let us know what you think.
