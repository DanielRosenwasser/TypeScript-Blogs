Congratulations to Fuse Labs on [releasing the new version of Socl][1]!  Fuse Labs was an early supporter of TypeScript, and they played a key role in helping to shape TypeScript into a language for web development at scale.  It's been great to see So.cl grow and use TypeScript to rapidly prototype and build the new site.

When you're done reading about it, be sure to give the [new Socl][2] a spin!
