We've released a hotfix to the 0.8.3 TypeScript for Visual Studio 2012 plugin.  The 0.8.3 preview release included a broad range of improvements to the TypeScript experience, but it also included an issue that caused editor performance to degrade significantly in some cases.  The hotfix release (0.8.3.1) addresses this issue and can be found [here][1].
